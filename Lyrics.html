         <h3>"Verse1"<br>
            When your legs don't work like they used to before<br>
          And I can't sweep you off of your feet<br>
          Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?<br>
          Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?<br>
           And darlin', I will be lovin' you till we're seventy<br>
           And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three</h3>
           <br>
         <p class="pre-Chorus">"pre-Chorus"<br>
            And I'm thinkin' 'bout how<br>
            People fall in love in mysterious ways<br>
            Maybe just the touch of a hand<br>
            Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day<br>
            And I just wanna tell you I am</p>

         <p class="Chorus">"Chorus"<br>
            So honey, now, take me into your lovin' arms<br>
            Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars<br>
            And place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud<br>
            Maybe we found love right where we are</p>

         <h3 class="Verse2">"Verse2"<br>
            When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades<br>
            And the crowds don't remember my name<br>
            When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mmm<br>
            I know you will still love me the same<br>
            'Cause, honey, your soul who could never grow old, it's evergreen<br>
            And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory</h3>

            <p class="pre-Chorus">"pre-Chorus"<br>
                I'm thinkin' 'bout how<br>
                People fall in love in mysterious ways<br>
                And maybe it's all part of a plan<br>
                Oh, I'll just keep on makin' the same mistakes<br>
                Hoping that you'll understand</p>

                <p class="Chorus">"Chorus"<br>
                    That, baby, now, take me into your lovin' arms<br>
                    Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars<br>
                    Place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud<br>
                    And maybe we found love right where we are, oh-oh</p>

                    <h3 class="Bridge">"Bridge"<br>
                     Lo-lo-lo, lo-lo-lo<br>
                     Lo-lo-lo, lo-lo-lo, love</h3>

                     <h3 class="Chorus">"Chorus"<br>
                        baby, now, take me into your lovin' arms<br> 
                      And kiss me under the light of a thousand stars, oh, darlin'<br>
                      Place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud<br>
                           That maybe we found love right where we are<br>
                           Oh, maybe we found love right where we are<br>
                           And we found love right where we are</h3>
